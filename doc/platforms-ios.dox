@brief Building, testing and deploying apps for Apple iOS platforms

@tableofcontents
@m_footernavigation

With Apple decision to focus on Metal, iOS OpenGL ES support is stuck on
version 3.0 (i.e., a version before compute shaders are available).

See also @ref Platform::Sdl2Application for more information. Some of the
@ref platforms-macos "macOS platform-specific info" applies here as well.

@section platforms-ios-best-practices Best practices

Official Apple documentation:

-   [Best Practices for Working with Vertex Data](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.html)
-   [Best Practices for Working with Texture Data](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/TechniquesForWorkingWithTextureData/TechniquesForWorkingWithTextureData.html)
-   [Best Practices for Shaders](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/BestPracticesforShaders/BestPracticesforShaders.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008793-CH7-SW3)

@section platforms-ios-troubleshooting Troubleshooting

-   GLSL @glsl texelFetch() @ce returns zero results if you have a texture with
    integer type and the filtering is not @ref SamplerFilter::Nearest. Yes, it
    shouldn't matter, but it does.

@todoc https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.8/prop_gbl/XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME.html and $<TARGET_FILE> property and https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/merge_requests/404, doesn't work for me on 3.10 and xcode 9.2 on Travis :/
@todoc CMake -G Xcode, testsuite integration, bundling, controlling xcode properties from cmake
@todoc CORRADE_TESTSUITE_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX
@todoc alternatives - including *.a files manually in your xcode project
@todoc move stuff from Sdl2App
@todoc static plugins
@todoc travis setup
