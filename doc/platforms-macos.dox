With Apple decision to focus on Metal, macOS OpenGL support is stuck on version
4.2 (i.e., a version before compute shaders are available).

@section platforms-macos-travis Setting up macOS build on Travis CI

A lot of Travis features is shared between Linux and macOS, see
@ref platforms-linux-travis for more information.

In general, a macOS build is done by adding the following to your `.travis.yml`
matrix build. See [the official documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/)
for more information.

@code{.yml}
matrix:
  include:
  - language: cpp
    os: osx
    compiler: clang
@endcode

Most of the build setup can be shared with Linux, as both systems have roughly
the same set of packages. For installing dependencies there's no builtin way,
but you can use Homebrew. Be aware that calling for example
@cb{.sh} brew install ninja @ce by default causes Homebrew to update itself
first. That currently (March 2018) takes almost two minutes. It's possible to
skip the update by setting an environment variable as shown below, however this
might fail in case you need a very recent version of a package.

@code{.sh}
HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1 brew install ninja
@endcode

@section platforms-macos-troubleshooting Troubleshooting

-   @ref GL::AbstractShaderProgram::validate() expects that the shader has a
    properly configured framebuffer bound along with proper @ref GL::Renderer
    setup. That is often hard to achieve, so the function cannot be portably
    used for shader validity testing.
-   `GL_TIMESTAMP` used by @ref GL::TimeQuery::timestamp() is not implemented
    on macOS and gives zero results.
